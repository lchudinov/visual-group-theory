# 1.5.4 Groups of numbers

Since group theory is a mathematical subject, it should not surprise us that numbers can
be formed into groups, in various ways.

**Exercise 1.13.** Pick any whole number and consider this set of actions: adding any
whole number to the one you chose. This is an infinite set of actions; we might name
them things like "add 1" and "add -17" Is it a group? If so, how small a set of generators
can you find?

Yes, it is a group with a single generator "add 1".

**Exercise 1.14.**
(a) What would be the answer to the previous exercise if we allowed only even numbers?

Yes, it is a group with a single generator "add 2".

(b) What would be the answer to the previous exercise if we allowed only whole numbers
from 0 to 10?

No, because (add 6) * (add 7) = (add 13) is not an action.

(c) What would be the answer to the previous exercise if we allowed all whole numbers,
but changed the set of actions to multiplying by any whole number? (I do not ask
you to consider those actions as generators, but as the complete set of actions.)

No, it's not a group because we can't reverse an action.


(d) What would be the answer to the previous exercise if we allowed only the numbers
1 and -1, and just two actions, multiplying by either 1 or -1?

It's a group with a single generator (mul -1).
