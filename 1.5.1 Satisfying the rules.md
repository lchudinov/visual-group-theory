# 1.5.1 Satisfying the rules

**Exercise 1.1.** Place a penny and a nickel side by side on a table or desk. Consider just
one action, the action of swapping the places of the two coins. Is this a group? (Check
each of the four rules to see if they are true for this situation. Explain your conclusion.)

Yes, it is a group because all the rules hold.

**Exercise 1.2.** Consider the same situation as in Exercise 1.1, but add a dime to the right
of the other two coins. The only action is still that of swapping the places of the penny
and nickel. Is this a group?

Yes, it is a group because all the rules hold. Nothing has changed we still can move only the penny and nickel.

**Exercise 1.3.** Imagine that you have five marbles in your left pocket. Consider two
actions, moving a marble from your left pocket into your right pocket and moving a
marble from your right pocket into your left pocket. Is this a group?

The list of possible actions depends on the current state.
If there is are no marbles in the left pocket, we cannot move anything to the right pocket.

**Exercise 1.4.** Three walls in your bedroom hold pieces of art, one hung on each wall.
You are rearranging them to see which arrangement best suits your taste. You cannot use
the fourth wall, because it has a window.
 - a. Count the number of ways there are to rearrange the pictures, as long as only one is hung on each wall.
   There are 6 ways to arrange them: `3 * 2 * 1 = 6`.
 - b. Consider two actions: You may swap the art on the left wall with the art on the center wall, and you may swap the art on the center wall with the art on the right wall. Can these two actions alone generate all of the configurations you counted?
   Sure.
 - c. Does part (b) describe a group? If not, what rule or rules were broken?
   Yes, it does.
 - d. Now add a new action, moving all art from the right wall to the center wall, even if this causes there to be more than one piece of art there. Is this new situation a group? If not, what rule or rules were broken?
   Not all moves possible because some wall may be empty.
