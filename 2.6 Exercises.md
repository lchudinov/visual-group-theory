## 2.6 Exercises

## 2.6.1 Basics

**Exercise 2.1.** In the rectangle puzzle, what actions were the generators? What other
actions are there besides the generators?

Actions were a horizontal flip and vertical flip. Other actions: any combination of the flips.

**Exercise 2.2.** In the light switch puzzle, what actions were the generators? What other
actions are there besides the generators?

Actions were a flip of switch 1 and flip of switch 2. 

**Exercise 2.3.** Can an arrow in a Cayley diagram ever connect a node to itself?

Yes, it is an identity action.

**Exercise 2.10.** If you’ve done all the exercises to this point, you’ve encountered two
different Cayley diagrams that have the two-node form shown here.

A --- B

Pendulum, which does tick-tack. Z_2. Propeller.

**Exercise 2.11.** If you’ve done all the exercises to this point, you’ve encountered two
different Cayley diagrams that have the four-node form shown here.

Can you come up with another group whose Cayley diagram has this form?

Two booleans flags in the config represent this group.

**Exercise 2.12.** We have not yet seen a group whose Cayley diagram has the three-node
form called C3, shown in the top left of Figure 2.10. Can you come up with a group
whose Cayley diagram has that form?

State-machine with 3 states. Triangle.

**Exercise 2.13.** A group’s generators have a special status in a Cayley diagram for the
group. What is that special status?

They are the arrows on the diagram.

**Exercise 2.14.** Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.5, which states, "There is
a predefined list of actions that never changes." How does this rule impact the appearance
of Cayley diagrams? (Or how would diagrams be different if this rule were not a
requirement?)

It would be impossible to draw such diagrams.

**Exercise 2.15.** Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.6, which states, "Every action
is reversible." What constraint does this place on the arrows in a Cayley diagram? Can
you draw a diagram that does not fit this constraint? (That is, draw a diagram that almost
deserves the name "Cayley diagram" except for that one rule violation.)

See the answer in the book.

**Exercise 2.16.** Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.7, which states, "Every action
is deterministic." What constraint does this place on the arrows in a Cayley diagram? Can
you draw a diagram that does not fit this constraint? (That is, draw a diagram that almost
deserves the name "Cayley diagram" except for that one rule violation.)

The action from A leads to B and C.

**Exercise 2.17.** Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.8, which states, "Any sequence
of consecutive actions is also an action." How do we depend upon this fact when using
a Cayley diagram as a map?

Hmm...

**Exercise 2.18.** If we created an equilateral triangle puzzle, like the square puzzle in
Exercise 2.8, what would the valid moves be? Map the group of such a puzzle.
