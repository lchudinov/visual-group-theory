## 2.6 Exercises

## 2.6.1 Basics

**Exercise 2.1.** In the rectangle puzzle, what actions were the generators? What other
actions are there besides the generators?

Actions were a horizontal flip and vertical flip. Other actions: any combination of the flips.

**Exercise 2.2.** In the light switch puzzle, what actions were the generators? What other
actions are there besides the generators?

Actions were a flip of switch 1 and flip of switch 2. 

**Exercise 2.3.** Can an arrow in a Cayley diagram ever connect a node to itself?

Yes, it is an identity action.

**Exercise 2.10.** If you’ve done all the exercises to this point, you’ve encountered two
different Cayley diagrams that have the two-node form shown here.

A --- B

Pendulum, which does tick-tack. Z_2. Propeller.

**Exercise 2.11.** If you’ve done all the exercises to this point, you’ve encountered two
different Cayley diagrams that have the four-node form shown here.

Can you come up with another group whose Cayley diagram has this form?

Two booleans flags in the config represent this group.

**Exercise 2.12.** We have not yet seen a group whose Cayley diagram has the three-node
form called C3, shown in the top left of Figure 2.10. Can you come up with a group
whose Cayley diagram has that form?

State-machine with 3 states. Triangle.

**Exercise 2.13.** A group’s generators have a special status in a Cayley diagram for the
group. What is that special status?

They are the arrows on the diagram.

**Exercise 2.14.** Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.5, which states, "There is
a predefined list of actions that never changes." How does this rule impact the appearance
of Cayley diagrams? (Or how would diagrams be different if this rule were not a
requirement?)

It would be impossible to draw such diagrams.

**Exercise 2.15.** Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.6, which states, "Every action
is reversible." What constraint does this place on the arrows in a Cayley diagram? Can
you draw a diagram that does not fit this constraint? (That is, draw a diagram that almost
deserves the name "Cayley diagram" except for that one rule violation.)

See the answer in the book.

**Exercise 2.16.** Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.7, which states, "Every action
is deterministic." What constraint does this place on the arrows in a Cayley diagram? Can
you draw a diagram that does not fit this constraint? (That is, draw a diagram that almost
deserves the name "Cayley diagram" except for that one rule violation.)

The action from A leads to B and C.

**Exercise 2.17.** Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.8, which states, "Any sequence
of consecutive actions is also an action." How do we depend upon this fact when using
a Cayley diagram as a map?

Hmm...

**Exercise 2.18.** If we created an equilateral triangle puzzle, like the square puzzle in
Exercise 2.8, what would the valid moves be? Map the group of such a puzzle.

Two actions: horizontal flip, rotate 120 degree. See the map in a separate file.

**Exercise 2.19.** A regular n-gon is a polygon with n equal sides and n equal angles. You
have already analyzed regular n-gons with n D 3 (equilateral triangle, Exercise 2.18) and
n D 4 (square, Exercise 2.8).
(a) Based on what you know about the cases when n D 3 and n D 4, make a conjecture
about how many actions will be in the group of the regular n-gon for any n > 2.

Two actions.

(b) Test your conjecture by making the map of the group for a regular pentagon (n D 5).

(c) Find the equilateral triangle group, the square group, and the regular pentagon group
in Group Explorer’s library. (Hint: Use the search feature.)
(i) Do your Cayley diagrams look like those in Group Explorer?
(ii) Does your conjecture hold up against all the data you can find in Group
Explorer?
(d) Write a paragraph giving as convincing an argument as you can in favor of your
conjecture. Try to anticipate the counterarguments of a skeptical reader.
The groups you studied in this exercise are called dihedral groups. We will return to them
in Exercise 4.9, and then formally study them in Chapter 5.
