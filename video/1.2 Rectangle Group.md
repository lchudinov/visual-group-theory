# Rectangle Group

`G = {e, h, v, r}`

- `e` - the identity action
- `h` - a horizontal flip
- `v` - a vertical flip
- `r` - a 180 degree rotation

`G = <h, v>` - the group is generated by h and v.

`r = hv = vh`

The order of actions in the group is irrelevant. We call such a group **abelian**.

`e = e^2 = h^2 = v^2 = r^2` - every action is its own inverse.

`e^(-1) = e h^(-1) = h v^(-1) = v r^(-1) = r`
