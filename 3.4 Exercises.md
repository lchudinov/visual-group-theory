## 3.4 Exercises

## 3.4.1 Basics

**Exercise 3.1.** Consider the six contra dance figures shown in Figure 3.15. Which of them,
if any, when repeated twice in succession, return the dancers to their original positions?
Which, if any, do not return the dancers to their original positions until the move is
repeated three times? Four? Do any figures require more repetitions than four to return
the dancers to their original positions?

> Which of them, if any, when repeated twice in succession, return the dancers to their original positions?

  2, 3, 4, 5, 6
  
> Which, if any, do not return the dancers to their original positions until the move is repeated three times?

  None of them.

> Four?

  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - actually, all of them.
  
> Do any figures require more repetitions than four to return the dancers to their original positions?

No, there are no such figures.

**Exercise 3.2.** Consider the horizontal flip shown on top of Figure 3.11. What is the
effect of repeating that action twice in succession? How is the glide reflection shown in
the same figure different?

> What is the effect of repeating that action twice in succession?

  No effect at all. The repeating twice will return the pattern to its original position.
  
> How is the glide reflection shown in the same figure different?

  Glide reflection = vertical flip + translation
  `g^2 = v t v t = v^2 t^2 = t^2` 
  
**Exercise 3.3.** Figure 3.4 shows that if you rotate a boric acid molecule clockwise onethird
of a full turn, it takes up the same space as it did originally. This clockwise rotation
generates the Cayley diagram shown in Figure 3.6. How would the diagram be different
if I had generated it with a counterclockwise rotation instead? Would the group size or
structure change?

> How would the diagram be different if I had generated it with a counterclockwise rotation instead?
  Instead of clockwise arrows, we would see counterclockwise arrows.

> Would the group size or structure change?
  No, only the directions of arrows would change.
  
**Exercise 3.4.** Name three physical manipulations you could do to the cube in Figure
3.7 that would rearrange its parts but leave it taking up the same space, as in step 2 of
Definition 3.1.

Rotations around x, y, z axis to 90 degrees.

## 3.4.2 The symmetry of molecules

**Exercise 3.5.** Apply the technique from Definition 3.1 to a molecule of ethylene, shown
below. (Include the optional Step 3.) Where have we seen the resulting group before and
what is its name?
The chemical formula for ethylene is C2H4; the dark atoms indicate carbon and the light
blue atoms indicate hydrogen. A scale model of this molecule would lie flat on a table;
it has no depth.
